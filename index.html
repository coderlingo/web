        <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
        <p><b>Goldman Sachs, Bangalore — Associate
            July 2019 - October 2021</b>
            Worked on building a search engine for e-communication data. It has 99% up
            time and servers return results from more than 10 trillion documents in less
            than a second. Technical components I am responsible for are:
        <ul>
            <li>Synonyms generation : Used various NLP and IR methods like word
                co-occurrence, word vectors to have a robust set of synonyms for a given
                word that include unigrams, abbreviations, acronyms etc. specific to the
                finance jargon. It involved building NLP algorithms to run over a hadoop
                cluster and providing this information as a service.
            </li>
            <li>Spell check over user queries : Implemented optimized spell check module
                based on Norvig’s algorithm and working on using language modeling to
                improve precision by using context information.
            </li>
            <li>Query parsing and query interpretation : Tagging known entities in a
                query and identifying ANTLR grammar rules to interpret user intent.
            </li>
            <li>Built the infra to calculate PR numbers for query interpretation output
                and synonyms generated to ease evaluating any changes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Highlights:</br>
        ● Complete ownership of the technical components and coming up with
        solutions and delivering results end to end.</br>
        ● Mentoring interns in the team, solving any technical problem faced by
        them in the duration of their project.

        <p>
            <b>Cisco Systems, Bangalore— Software Engineer
                August 2017 - June 2019</b>
            Worked on Cisco’s range of products like routers and switches for
            authentication, authorization and accounting of a new user. Got an
            understanding of working with systems and C language.
        </p>
        <h3>RESEARCH BACKGROUND</h3>
        <b>Master’s Thesis:</b> Built a knowledge base of technical terms by collecting
        technical structured/unstructured texts from sources like Wikipedia, textbooks,
        technical websites and extracted triples depicting relations between technical
        concepts. The knowledge base was then used to classify technical documents into

        the domains they belong to. A paper titled "Construction and Applications of
        TeKnowbase: A Knowledge Base of Computer Science Concepts" acknowledging our
        work was published in WWW’18. Primary skills involved information retrieval and
        machine learning.
        <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>IIT Delhi, Delhi — MTech in Computer Science
                July 2015 - July 2017
                CGPA:7.77
            </li>
            <li>Meghnad Saha Institute Of Technology, Kolkata — BTech in Computer
                Science
                August 2010 - July 2014
                CGPA:8.6
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> OTHER PROJECTS</h3>
        ● Digit Recognition : Recognition of handwritten digits taken from MNIST
        dataset using Artificial Neural Networks (backpropagation algorithm).</br>
        ● Person Recognition : Prediction of similarity between two persons given
        their image properties using Gaussian Support Vector Machines.</br>
        ● Document Classifier : Classification of 20-Newsgroups dataset using Naive
        Bayes algorithm with 5-fold cross validation.</br>
        ● Pastry Network : A scalable peer to peer network that uses distributed
        hash tables and multithreading for efficient storage and retrieval of
        data.</br>
        ● 2D - Soccer game : Designed the game using OpenGL to be played in single
        and multiplayer mode over the network. Modeled bots along with user
        controlled players.</br>
        ● Being interested in gaming, I build my own 3D
        animated vertical shooter game for PC and Xbox. It primarily used XNA, C# and
        .NET framework. Along with the technical gain, I got a chance to lead a team of
        5 people and see the project through with success.</br>
