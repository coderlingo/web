<h1>How HashMap Works in Java</h1>
<p>Before understanding how hashMap works, we should be aware of the object heirachy of java.
    Any class defined in java by default implements the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html">Object</a> class.
    With it, it inherits a set of methods that are called as part of underlying operations of many popularly used methods. Some of them include
    notify(), wait() etc. from threads construct. While notify, wait are popularly used by devopers, and hence well known,
    some methods like toString() are invoked whne printing a class object and often times without the knowledge of the developer.
    Similary, when hashMap is used by any developer, 2 Object class methods hashCode() and equals() work in the
    background to make hashmap possible. </p>
