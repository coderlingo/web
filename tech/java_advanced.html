      <h3>Important concepts on Java concurrency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>State:</b> An objects state is the data stored in the state variable such as instances or static variables.</li>
            <li>When more than one threads can update an objects state, there is a need for synchronization.</li>
            <li>The problem which occurs because of 2 threads competing for shared resource is called <b>race condition</b>.</li>
            <li>2 main type of operations in applications that can cause race condition in thread are:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Check-then-act : example is lazy initialization
                <li>Read-modify-write: example is increment operation</li>
            </ul>
            <main>
                <figure>
                    <figcaption>Lazy Initialization Race condition</figcaption>
                    <pre>
                    <code>
        public class LazyInit {
            SomeObject someObject = null;
            public LazyInit() {
                if(someObject == null) {
                    someObject = new SomeObject();
                }
                return someObject;
            }
        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                </figure>
            </main>
            <li><b>java.util.concurrency.atomic</b> package has thread safe versions of primitive data type to help with race conditions associated with
            increment operation. Example : AtomicLong. These data types make sure that read-then-update operations are not optimized by the compiler and are atomic.
            </li>
            <li>But despite AtomicLong, there can exist race conditions because of multiple variable depend on each other and need to be updated to be in sync. </li>
            <li><b>Intrinsic locks:</b> To solve the above problem, intrinsic locks is a solution. When a block of code needs to be preformed atomically,
            it can be put in a lock. Only threads that have access to the lock can change the code. And since intrinsic locks are by default mutex, only one thread can hold it at a time.</li>
            <pre>
                    <code>
        synchronized(lock) {
            increment++;
        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            By definition, every java oject can act as a lock implicitly. These are called intrinsic locks.
            Intrinsic locks are also reentrant. Which means the thread holding a lock can request for the same lock again and will not be blocked because of mutex nature.
            <li>Each mutable state variable that maybe access by multiple threads from different places need to have the same lock.</li>
            <li><b>@GuardedBy("this")</b> is used to tell what is a variable guarded with. every access to this variable need to be guarded with the same.</li>
            <li>When we use synchronized block in a piece of code, the block should be small enough to use concurrency well. And large enough that the overhead of
            acquiring and releasing locks is not there.</li>
        </ul>
