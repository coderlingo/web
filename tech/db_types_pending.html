      <p>There are different types of DBs that are used in a variety of distributed applications these days. There are multiple DBs out there like mongoDB, redis, cassandra,
      Hbase to name a very few of the popular ones. But these DBs can be clubbed together into broad categories and not every DB suits every problem that a developer might
      come across in the course of his career. Thus its important to have an understanding of the types of DBs out there and the specific purpose that they serve. </p>
      <p>The databases can be broadly classified into the following categories:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Relational Database</li>
          <li>Document-Oriented Database</li>
          <li>Graph Database</li>
          <li>Key-Value Database</li>
          <li>Time Series Database</li>
          <li>Wide-Column Database</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Relational Database</h3>
      Structured representation of data. Data has attributes and well-defined relation between them. Usually works well for transactional data since such tables
      ensure strong ACID properties. These databases do not scale well. To extract tricky relations from the database, joins need to be performed which can be an
      expensive operation. A lot of effort is needed in the initial phases for coming up with a normalized schema for the db.</br>
      <b>Examples:</b> MySQL(open source), PostGreSQL(open source)

      </ul>
      <h3>Document-Oriented Database</h3>

      <b>Examples:</b> MongoDB, CouchDB, Amazon DocumentDB etc.
      <h3>Graph Database</h3>
      <b>Examples:</b> Neo4j
      <h3>Key-Value Database</h3>
      <b>Examples:</b> Redis, Hazelcast, Riak, Voldemort, and Memcached.
      <h3>Time Series Database</h3>
      <b>Examples:</b> Influx DB
      <h3>Wide-Column Database</h3>
      Refer to <a href="https://coderlingo.github.io/web/tech/hbase.html">HBase basics</a> for understanding hBase wide column database. Prior knowledge of Hadoop is recommended.</br>
      <b>Examples:</b> Cassandra, Hbase, BigTable etc.
