      <p>There are different types of DBs that are used in a variety of distributed applications these days. There are multiple DBs out there like mongoDB, redis, cassandra,
      Hbase to name a very few of the popular ones. But these DBs can be clubbed together into broad categories and not every DB suits every problem that a developer might
      come across in the course of his career. Thus its important to have an understanding of the types of DBs out there and the specific purpose that they serve. </p>
      <p>The databases can be broadly classified into the following categories:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Relational Database</li>
          <li>Document-Oriented Database</li>
          <li>Graph Database</li>
          <li>Key-Value Database</li>
          <li>Time Series Database</li>
          <li>Wide-Column Database</li>
      </ul>
